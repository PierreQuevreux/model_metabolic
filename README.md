model_metabolic

Models used in the article "Metabolic adjustment enhances food web stability"

Program coded in C++ and using the GSL ODE solver (v 1.13).

Foodchain

Simulation of a tri-trophic food chain with a primary producer, a herbivore and a carnivore. The program records the dynamics of the biomasses and of the metabolic rates. The data for a diagram of bifurcation are also produced (calculations of local extrema along parameter gradients).

Foodchain_Lyapunov

Simulation calculating the Lyapunov exponents of the food chain (dimension 5).

Foodweb

Simulation of a complex food web with up to 40 interactin species. Time dynamics of species biomasses and metabolic rates are recorded.
